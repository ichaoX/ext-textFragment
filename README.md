# Firefox Text Fragment Extension

Auto scroll to text fragment (#:~:text) and allow you to create link for selected text. It can be installed at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/text-fragment/.

## Notes

Firefox for Android currently does not support the context menu, you need to click on the extension icon instead.
