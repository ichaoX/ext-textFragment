# Firefox Text Fragment Extension

Auto scroll to text fragment (#:~:text) and allow you to create link for selected text. It can be installed at https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/text-fragment/.

## Notes

* Firefox for Android currently does not support the context menu, you need to click on the extension icon instead.

* In Firefox 131 or later, the browser's native "scroll to text fragment" implementation will be used by default. If you wish to use this extension's implementation, you can either uncheck "Disable this extension feature when natively supported" in this extension's preferences page, or disable "dom.text_fragments.enabled" in "about:config" and restart the browser.
